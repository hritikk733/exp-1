Image processing is a field of computer science and engineering that involves the manipulation and analysis of images to enhance, extract information, or transform them into a more useful form.
This is achieved through various algorithms and techniques that process images at the pixel level or on a more complex feature level. Below is an overview of the core concepts and theory behind image processing:
